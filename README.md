# This is the source code for my personal portfolio website.

### I used a mix of basic web tools and some pretty cool animation libraries to make everything feel "alive":

- HTML5, CSS3 (with lots of glassmorphism), and Vanilla JavaScript.

- That interactive polygon net in the back? That's Three.js and Vanta.js.

- I used AOS (Animate On Scroll) so things pop up as you scroll, and GSAP for the smooth transitions.

- Font Awesome for the social/tech icons and Inter from Google Fonts for that clean look.

- Most of these libraries are pulled from CDNs (like Cloudflare and JSDelivr) so the site stays snappy.
